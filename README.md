# SPlus-Primal-Fear-Resources
All Primal Fear resources for S+ Dedicated Storage!

I spent a lot of time going through every folder of Primal Fear (ALL DLC MODS) to get this list of resources. I really wanted to add the resources to our cluster
so that our players and myself didnt have resources scattered in Tek Storage. This is a much cleaner solution.

At the bottom there are 2 lines you can remove, or leave it wont matter either way. This puts Transferable Element and Transferable Shards into the dedi from thee
mod called Ultra Stacks. (MOD https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761535755)
